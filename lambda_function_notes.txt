=> You can write/create lambda functions in 2 ways:
    I) From inline code editor aws console provides
    II) By uploading zip file either from local or s3 bucket


=> Steps for creating a zip file lambda function
    1. Create a directory in your local. ex: test1
    2. Now create a virutalenvironment. ex: mytestenv1
        => virtualenv mytestenv1
    3. Activate virtualenv
        => source mytestenv1/bin/activate
    4. Install dependencies of python.
        Ex: django, pillow
        => pip install django pillow
    5. Deactivate virtualenv
        => deactivate
    7. Create a file having name "lambda_function.py"
        => touch lambda_function.py
    8. Now, create a function with name lambda_handler in it accepting "event" and "context" as arguments.
        =>  def lambda_handler(event, context):
                # your logic
                return {
                    "status_code": 200,
                    "message": "Success"
                }
    9. change directory to site-packages where all python dependencies are installed
        and run command to create a deployment package with the installed libraries at the root.
        => cd myvenv/lib/python3.8/site-packages
        => zip -r ../../../../my-deployment-package_name.zip .

    10. change directory back to root and add function code files to the root of your deployment package.
        => cd ../../../../
        => zip -g my-deployment-package_name.zip lambda_function.py

    ::NOTE::
    If you don't install and create zip from installed package and you get error can't import error while
    executing lambda function then either add layer with that dependency or follow the same process i.e.
    install package in activated virtual environment and then create zip again and you function code files in that zip.


=> Steps to add layer for missing module/dependency:
    1. Watch this video:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1OlJzduGZ0
    2. Copy/download code from here:
        https://github.com/soumilshah1995/create-aws-layers-for-python-lambda
    3. Execute this file and it will create the layer for missing package for specific python version
    4. Now go to layers section and create a layer then upload this zip file.
    5. After that go to your lambda function and add this layer(created recently).
